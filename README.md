## 1. What It Is

**VeryMcProto** is a **Paper plugin** that **re-implements the network protocols and data collection expected by several Fabric protocol mods** on a standard Paper 26.2 server (or its downstream fork Purpur 26.2), so that a "Fabric client + Paper server" combination behaves exactly like a "Fabric client + vanilla Fabric server mod" combination.

> **It is a *protocol-layer port*, not a port of the Fabric mods themselves.** The client keeps using masa's / endte's / JEI's own Fabric mods; our job is to implement on the Paper server the **custom network channels + server→client data delivery + server-side behavior cooperation** they expect.

Why this is necessary:

- The server-side parts of these protocol mods rely heavily on **NMS internals** — unreachable via the pure Paper API (see the [FAQ](#8-faq)).
- They use **Mojang's vanilla `CustomPacketPayload`** mechanism; Paper's plugin messaging channels map directly onto it, and S2C large packets can go via NMS `ClientboundCustomPayloadPacket`.
- Server-side cooperative features (e.g. EasyPlace) use Mixin in the original; Paper has no Mixin runtime, so an equivalent is implemented via **PacketEvents**.

This project uses **paperweight `userdev`** to reference fully-deobfuscated Mojang NMS at dev time. **Since MC 26.1 Paper no longer supports remapping plugins to Spigot mappings** (Mojang removed server obfuscation), the build artifact is the **Mojang-mapped jar itself** — standard Paper 26.1+ loads it directly. **It depends on no server patch / Mixin / private fork.**

## 2. Protocol Mods

| Mod | Client Mod | Nature | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Servux** | masa's **MiniHUD / Litematica / Tweakeroo** | Server→client **one-way broadcast** (6 providers over `servux:*` channels) | ✅ Full |
| **JEI** | **JEI** (mezz/JustEnoughItems 26.2) | **Full server protocol**: recipe sync + cheat + recipe transfer (`fabric:recipe_sync` / `neoforge:recipe_content` + 10 `jei:*` channels) | ✅ Full |
| **Syncmatica** | **endte syncmatica** | **Bidirectional, stateful, multi-player shared** schematic repository (`syncmatica:main` + 18 PacketTypes + Exchange sessions) | ✅ Full |

**Servux** delivers world metadata / spawn / weather / TPS / MobCap, structure bounding boxes, entity & block-entity NBT queries, and Litematica schematic paste (C2S upload + server-side paste). EasyPlace (Tweakeroo precise placement) is served via PacketEvents. The S2C file-transmit path was removed — the stock 26.x clients have no receiver for it.

**JEI**: recipe sync (loader-level channels, join-time packet ordering via `RecipeSyncJoinOrderer`), the `jei:*` cheat/transfer channels with a server-side permission model, and the line-by-line ported `BasicRecipeTransferHandlerServer`.

**Syncmatica**: the server acts as a central `.litematic` repository; players upload / download / collaboratively modify placements through Exchange request-acknowledgement sessions, with JSON persistence and upload quotas.

> 26.1 introduced hard client-side gates (protocol versions must match exactly; the `servux` handshake string must start with `servux-fabric-<exact upstream MC id>`), a new DataTag NBT wire carrier, and a 16MB client reassembly cap. All of this is implemented and documented in [`docs/09-DELIVERY.md`](docs/09-DELIVERY.md) §26.1.
> 26.2 does not change any of these protocol surfaces. The 26.2 upgrade needed only build changes and fixes for three renamed Minecraft internals. The record of this upgrade is in [`docs/09-DELIVERY.md`](docs/09-DELIVERY.md) §26.2.

Protocol deep-dives: [docs/02](docs/02-network-protocol.md) (Servux network) · [docs/21](docs/21-syncmatica-protocol.md) (Syncmatica) · [docs/30](docs/30-jei-protocol.md) (JEI).

## 3. Requirements

### Server

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Server | **Paper 26.2** or **Purpur 26.2** (`api-version: '26.2'`; standard builds, no patch / private fork needed) |
| Java | **25** |
| Optional | **PacketEvents 2.13.0** (supports 26.2; only for EasyPlace; if absent it is gracefully skipped — everything else is unaffected) |

### Client

| Feature family | Client must install |
| --- | --- |
| All of Servux (HUD / structures / NBT query / schematic paste / EasyPlace) | **MiniHUD** + **Litematica** + **Tweakeroo** (the masa suite, 26.2 LTS) |
| JEI recipe sync + cheat + recipe transfer | **JEI** (mezz/JustEnoughItems, 26.2 line) |
| Schematic sharing | **Syncmatica** (endte client, 26.2 LTS) |

> The client version must match the server's **MC version (26.2)**. The client is the "receiving end" of these protocols; every field semantic and reassembly behavior is verified against the client sources.

---

## 4. Installation

1. Get `VeryMcProto-26.2-b1.jar` from the project Releases page, or build it with `./gradlew build` (the Mojang-mapped artifact loads directly on standard Paper 26.2 and Purpur 26.2 — no reobf step exists anymore).
2. Drop it into the server's `plugins/` directory.
3. **(Optional, only for EasyPlace)** Install the PacketEvents plugin.
4. Restart the server; players join with the corresponding client Fabric mods — handshake is automatic.

On startup the console shows:

```
[VeryMcProto] 启动中 (MC 26.2, paper)...
[VeryMcProto] 已注册协议 mod: servux
[VeryMcProto] 已注册协议 mod: jei
[VeryMcProto] 已注册协议 mod: syncmatica
[VeryMcProto] 服务端启动完成，已捕获 RegistryAccess 并加载 servux.json。
[VeryMcProto] 框架就绪。
```

> **Defensive design**: the three mods are assembled each inside its own try-catch; any one failing only logs and degrades gracefully — **it never blocks server startup** and never affects the other mods.

Commands (`/servux`, `/syncmatica`, `/jei`), permission nodes (incl. LuckPerms recipes), every config key of `servux.json` / `jei.json` / `syncmatica-config.json`, the on-disk data layout, and a troubleshooting table live in **[`docs/40-configuration.md`](docs/40-configuration.md)**.

---

## 5. Architecture

Package root `verymc.top.veryMcProto`, split into a **framework layer** and a **protocol-mod layer**:

```
verymc.top.veryMcProto
├── VeryMcProto            Main class (JavaPlugin.onEnable assembles the framework + registers the three mods + registers commands)
├── framework/             Framework layer (infrastructure decoupled from any specific protocol mod)
│   ├── network/           plugin messaging channel wrappers, byte-stream codec, splitting, handler registry
│   ├── dataproviders/     Provider registry / scheduler / config hub (used by Servux)
│   ├── event/             Bukkit event → Provider lifecycle bridge (ServerLoad/Join/Quit/Respawn/RegisterChannel + tick)
│   ├── debug/             Generic debug logging engine (independent instances per mod; master + category orthogonal; persisted)
│   ├── permission/ reflect/ nms/ settings/ util/   permission utility, NMS reflection, conversions, config system, JSON utils
└── mod/                   Protocol-mod layer (each ported Fabric protocol mod occupies one directory unit)
    ├── servux/            Servux (app/command/dataproviders/network/easyplace/loggers/schematic/scheduler/util)
    ├── jei/               JEI full server protocol (recipe sync + jei:* channels)
    └── syncmatica/        Syncmatica (communication/exchange/data/litematica/service/...)
```

**Assembly** (`VeryMcProto.onEnable`): initialize the framework → register `servux` → `jei` → `syncmatica` → register the three commands; every step is individually try-catch guarded.

The full Fabric→Paper replacement map (lifecycle hooks → Bukkit events, `ServerPlayNetworking` → plugin messaging + NMS direct send, Mixin → reflection/PacketEvents/omission, etc.), the degradation matrix and the feasibility argument are in [`docs/07-migration-architecture.md`](docs/07-migration-architecture.md).

> **Maintainers & AI assistants**: read **[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)** first — it is the canonical repo guide (architecture, branch/version model, core design constraints, working conventions).
>
> **Original implementation archive**: `OriginImpl/` holds the original Fabric sources of every ported mod for line-by-line comparison — **in case of divergence, the real source wins**.

## 6. Feature Matrix

The original Servux has **26 Mixins + 2 AccessWideners**; Syncmatica has **5 server-side Mixins**. Paper has no Mixin runtime, so each is handled per the table below (full matrix: [docs/07](docs/07-migration-architecture.md) §4):

| Feature | Handling | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol data collection (reading private fields) | **Reflection / direct NMS access** | ✅ |
| Collection triggers / lifecycle | **Bukkit events + tick scheduling** | ✅ |
| **EasyPlace** (Tweakeroo precise placement) | **PacketEvents intercepts `PLAYER_BLOCK_PLACEMENT` + replays `BlockItem.place` side effects** | ✅ needs PacketEvents |
| **Mirror fixes** (chest/rail/stairs) | **Inlined fixes on paste** (`fix_chest_mirror` / `fix_rail_rotations` / `fix_stairs_mirror`) | ✅ (rail/stairs may be less perfect than Mixin) |
| **Fill/Delete via servux tasks** (26.1 new) | `PACKET_C2S_TASK_REQUEST` group (types 14-17): per-tick budgeted fill/delete + InfoHud status sync | ✅ (26.1+) |
| **UpdateSuppression** | ⛔ **Omitted** (no Paper equivalent) | ❌ |
| **Shulker-box stacking** | ⛔ **Impossible + all code removed** (see [FAQ](#8-faq)) | ❌ |
| Debug (`SharedConstants.IS_RUNNING_IN_IDE`) | Omitted | — |

## 8. FAQ

**Q: Why must we use paperweight / NMS instead of the pure Paper API?**
A: Data collection depends heavily on NMS internals (`NaturalSpawner.SpawnState`, `ServerTickRateManager`, `ChunkAccess.getAllReferences()`, `StructureStart.createTag()`, `Recipe.CODEC` + `NbtOps`, `BlockEntity.saveWithFullMetadata()`); the network layer reuses vanilla `FriendlyByteBuf` / `CompoundTag`; and JEI/Syncmatica large-packet S2C relies on NMS `ClientboundCustomPayloadPacket`. The pure Paper API cannot reach these.

**Q: Why does Syncmatica default to NMS direct send instead of plugin messaging?**
A: Testing showed the pure Fabric syncmatica client is unreachable over the plugin-messaging wire and only reachable via NMS `DiscardedPayload` direct send.

**Q: Do shulker-box stacking / UpdateSuppression work?**
A: ⛔ No. The former alters a global NMS method (no Mixin / no equivalent on Paper; all code removed); the latter needs a Mixin adding an interface to `Level`/`LevelChunk`, and is omitted.

**Q: What happens if PacketEvents isn't installed for EasyPlace?**
A: EasyPlace is skipped automatically (`EasyPlaceBootstrap` reflective load + `catch(Throwable)` fallback); all other Servux channels, JEI, and Syncmatica are completely unaffected.

**Q: What's the difference between `permission_level` 2 and 3?**
A: Under pure Bukkit op there is **no difference** (both go through the `isOp()` binary). To differentiate levels, use LuckPerms to explicitly grant the corresponding permission node (see [docs/40](docs/40-configuration.md) §2).

**Q: Does it run on Purpur?**
A: Yes. Purpur is a downstream fork of Paper. The plugin uses no Paper-only detection. Therefore the same jar works on both servers. We tested it on Purpur 26.2 build 2633. The plugin loads and enables all three modules. All servux channels answer the handshake. JEI recipe sync and the Syncmatica handshake start in the same way as on Paper (see [docs/09](docs/09-DELIVERY.md) §26.2.6). The startup log line shows `paper` on both servers because it only names the build target.

**Q: What does pasting a schematic require?**
A: The player needs creative mode + the `servux.provider.litematic_data.paste` permission (governed by `litematic_data:permission_level_paste`, default 0 = everyone).

## 9. Credits

This project is a Paper protocol-layer port of the following Fabric protocol mods — full credit to the original authors and the maintainers who keep them alive:

- **Servux** — originally by **masa** ([`maruohon/servux`](https://github.com/maruohon/servux)); now maintained by **sakura-ryoko** ([`sakura-ryoko/servux`](https://github.com/sakura-ryoko/servux)). The server-side protocol implementation delivering data to MiniHUD / Litematica / Tweakeroo.
- **Litematica / malilib / MiniHUD / Tweakeroo / Item Scroller** — originally by **masa** (`maruohon/*`); now maintained by **sakura-ryoko** since masa retired from active development — the 26.x LTS builds all live under sakura-ryoko:
  - [`sakura-ryoko/litematica`](https://github.com/sakura-ryoko/litematica) · [`sakura-ryoko/malilib`](https://github.com/sakura-ryoko/malilib) · [`sakura-ryoko/minihud`](https://github.com/sakura-ryoko/minihud) · [`sakura-ryoko/tweakeroo`](https://github.com/sakura-ryoko/tweakeroo) · [`sakura-ryoko/itemscroller`](https://github.com/sakura-ryoko/itemscroller)
  - These are the client-side receivers of the protocols.
- **Syncmatica** — originally by **endte** ([`End-Tech/syncmatica`](https://github.com/End-Tech/syncmatica)); now maintained by **sakura-ryoko** ([`sakura-ryoko/syncmatica`](https://github.com/sakura-ryoko/syncmatica)). The shared schematic central repository.
- **JustEnoughItems (JEI)** — by **mezz** ([`mezz/JustEnoughItems`](https://github.com/mezz/JustEnoughItems), `26.2` branch). **The JEI upstream since 2026-09** — the full server protocol (recipe sync via loader channels + `jei:*` cheat/transfer channels) is ported from it.
- **JEIRecipeBridge** — by **Mrbysco** ([`Mrbysco/JEIRecipeBridge`](https://github.com/Mrbysco/JEIRecipeBridge)). The historical JEI recipe-sync reference (1.21.11 line still uses it; kept in `OriginImpl/` for the neoforge-layer wire reference).
